# ConCodeRep
The implementation of "Adding Context to Source Code Representations for Deep 
Learning"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dataset
This research is based on the dataset *SeSaMe*. 
<https://github.com/FAU-Inf2/sesame>

* If you want to replicate the experiments in this project, you have to download 
the *SeSaMe* dataset and follow its authors' instructions to download the 11 
projects. 

## Jar
To do the next experiments, you must have *jar* packages for all the projects in 
the dataset. You can go one of the following two ways. 

* You can manually install them according to the documentation for each project 
or look for *jar* releases in a project's *github* repository.

* If you find the process above cumbersome, you can also use the *jar* packages 
stored in the **jar_pack** folder.
